## Concept

### User Story
AS A person living through the Covid-19 pandemic

I WANT to get out of the house.

HOWEVER, current conditions prevent me from planning my travel too far in advance.

I NEED a way to plan for last-minute trips.

The Spontaneous Adventurer serves as a guide for last-minute getaways and day trips, providing current information on events, nearby parks, weather conditions, and current COVID-19 conditions in a given location. 

In this time of uncertainty, a last-minute getaway can reduce anxiety that comes from staying home. The Spontaneous Adventurer provides the information needed to plan a successful adventure at a traveler's fingertips.

## Process
The project was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. The project also utilized Moment, Skeleton, and Google Fonts.

The following APIs were used:
* COVID Tracking
* National Parks Service
* TicketMaster
* Open Weather

Each team member was assigned an element of the application. 

* Taylor handled the HTML layout, the CSS framework, and created the COVID function.
* Tracey created the National Parks function and error display.
* Sharee created the Ticketmaster function.
* Rachel created the functions for local storage and persistent data.

While each team member had their own role, the project was truly a group effort with several study sessions to work through challenges together.

### Challenges:
* Learning to use GitHub as a team to push and merge different branches
* Finding a method or creating a function to prevent the search history from duplication

### Successes: 
* Learning to use GitHub as a team.
* Communicating and working as a team.
