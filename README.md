## Concept

### User Story
AS A person living through the Covid-19 pandemic
I WANT to get out of the house.
HOWEVER, current conditions prevent me from planning my travel too far in advance.
I NEED a way to plan for last-minute trips.

The Spontaneous Adventurer serves as a guide for last-minute getaways and day trips, providing current information on events, nearby parks, weather conditions, and current COVID-19 conditions in a given location. 

In this time of uncertainty, a last-minute getaway can reduce anxiety that comes from staying home. The Spontaneous Adventurer provides the information needed to plan a successful adventure at a traveler's fingertips.
